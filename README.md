this is just the old engine i was working on, i couldnt commit the latest changes and my disk corrupted,
and now i am working on a better engine with really tidy codebase and no functions written by ai(or least idk i havent gotten help from ai yet. i will try to be original as much as possible)
the current project i am working on is on a private repository.
